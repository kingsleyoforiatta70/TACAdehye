                    In 1904-5, Wales experienced an outbreak of a revival which had tremendous effects on many parts of the British Isles. This was followed by a MIGHTY VISITATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, which fell simultaneously on many parts of the world, during which many received the baptism of the Holy Spirit with signs following.

                <p>
                    As a result, there sprung up Pentecostal groups worldwide which also believed that the gifts of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers of Ephesians 4:11 should operate in the church together with the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit spelt out in 1 Corinthians 12:1-11. The Apostolic Church was therefore born in 1915 in Penygroes, South Wales; United Kingdom.

                    It was a vision of Apostolic doctrine that gripped the first leader of the Fellowship, Daniel Powell Williams, who in 1913, was ordained an Apostle in the Body of Christ and later became the first President of the Apostolic Church Council and remained so until his death in 1947. The Lord also called his brother, William Jones Williams, as a prophet in the Body of Christ. In 1913, he was ordained into full-time ministry of the Church.

                <p>
                    Thus they were called together with others to demonstrate the New Testament offices of Apostle and Prophet in the United Kingdom.

                <p>
                    Subsequently these ministries were exercised in other countries and Continents of the World. With time, the Lord in a remarkable way brought many groups to link with the Church in Penygroes under the name of the Apostolic Church, and Ghana was no exception. The Gold Coast, now Ghana saw the emergence of Christians in the country who were seeking spiritual awakening in their hearts and lives. This desire to know more about spiritual truths drove many to write for literature from various missions abroad. Through contacts with the Faith Tabernacle of Nigeria, a group of Christians at the small town of Asamankese were introduced to The Apostolic Church, which had started a missionary work in Nigeria. The Asamankese group then requested The Apostolic Church in Bradford, England, that a delegation should visit them. As a result in 1935, Pastor George Perfect, a British Missionary who had been posted to Nigeria was directed by the Missionary Office in Bradford, to visit the Christian group at Asamankese.

                <p>
                    This group of believers experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit and needed instructions and guidance. Pastor George Perfect met the Asamakese group led by the late Apostle Peter Newman Anim.

                <p>
                    Eventually, the Asamankese group accepted to become members of The Apostolic Church and wholeheartedly embraced the Tenets of the Church. Pastor George Perfect formally ordained the leader of the group, Pastor Peter Newman Anim as the first African Minister of The Apostolic Church, Gold Coast.

                    In 1936, Pastor Vivian Wellings, the then Missionary Secretary of the Church in Bradford visited the infant Apostolic Church at Asamankese. On his return to Bradford, England, he recommended that a resident Missionary should be sent to Asamankese because the new Church was growing at a fast rate.

                    On 2nd March 1937, Pastor James Mckeown arrived in the then Gold Coast to take up the mantle as the first resident Missionary. His wife, Sophia arrived later in September, the same year to support her husband. Barely six months after his arrival, was Pastor James Mckeown taken ill with malaria fever. A controversy broke out over his being taken to the European Hospital in Accra by an English District Commissioner.

                <p>
                    The Faith Tabernacle Church members who had joined The Apostolic Church still held in a fanatic way, the doctrine of divine healing. During a Christmas convention at Asamankese, Pastor Mckeown's belief in medication was questioned by Pastor Anim and some of the Elders. This led to a split in the infant Church with Pastor Anim leading a breakaway and formed Christ Apostolic Church.

                <p>
                    The members from Akroso led by the late Pastor R. S. Asomaning, together with Brother C. K. Frimpong, (a.k.a. Odoom), J. S. Gyima, J. A. Bimpong, K. Nyarko, R. H. Gyima, Philip Anor, Kwaku Asare and J. W. Amoako accepted Pastor Mckeown's leadership and remained in The Apostolic Church. They arranged for him to move from Asamankese to Akroso and later to Winneba where there were some brethren who also accepted to continue with The Apostolic Church.

                    Three years later the headquarters of the Apostolic Church was transferred to Cape Coast where a Church had been planted. The Apostolic Church however flourished rapidly throughout the country with Pastor Mckeown as the Superintendent Missionary. He was supported by Pastor R. S. Asomaning, J. A. C. Anaman, J. A. Bimpong, D. K. Boateng, S. K. Frimpong and others.

                    In 1944 some Christian believers including Pastor Lartey Adotey, Pastor A. S. Mallet, Elder Q. A. L. Quarshie, (all deceased) and Pastor C. K. Diaba and others invited The Apostolic Church from Cape Coast to establish the Church in Accra. The Church in Accra under the leadership of the late Pastor Anaman flourished so quickly that in 1948 the headquarters of the Church was transferred to Accra. More Missionaries were later posted from England to strengthen the work in the then Gold Coast Pastor C. B. Sercombe arrived in 1943 to be the Vice Superintendent. Pastor Adams Mckeown, Brother of Pastor James Mckeown as a Prophet arrived in December 1944. Pastor Albert Seaborne came in 1946, followed by Pastor S. M. Hammond in 1948. Others were Pastor H. L. Copp in 1953 and Pastor C. H. Rosser in 1962. Pastor F. Johnson arrived in 1966, and Pastor P. W. Cawthorne in 1971. Then Pastor E. H. Williams also arrived in 1973.

                <p>
                    After many years of difficulties dating back to 1953, a large section of the Church finally followed Pastor James Mckeown to form the Gold Coast Apostolic Church, then Ghana Apostolic Church. And in 1962 the name was changed to The Church of Pentecost. Other Churches like The Divine Healers Church, The Apostolic Reformed Church, and The New Covenant Apostolic Church are all off shoots of The Apostolic Church.

                <p>
                    However, the Lord has continued to bless His Church in a wonderful way, and today there are more than one thousand five hundred local Churches in Ghana.

                <p>
                    The Church has also been instrumental in establishing the glorious vision and the seed of truth in Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, La Cote D'Ivoire, United Kingdom and North America. The Apostolic Church, Ghana celebrated her Golden Jubilee in 1985.

                    In 1985, the Church in Ghana attained Autonomy and the First Ghanaian President Apostle A. Ofori-Addo was appointed who served from 1985 to 1986. Pastor P. Attah Antwi followed from 1986 to 1996.

                    The Administrative Management Committee performed the functions of the Presidency from 1996 to 1997, followed by the Presidential Board from 1997 to 1998. Apostle Joseph Anim was appointed the President in July 1998 during the National Council Meeting. After two successive terms of office, Apostle Joseph Anim handed over the Presidency to Apostle John Annan Adotey on 8th July 2006.

                <p>
                    Apostle John Annan Adotey successfully steered the Church through its 75th Anniversary celebration in 2010, and retired on 29th May 2011. His successor, Apostle E. N. Abebrese was inducted into office on 28th May 2011.
